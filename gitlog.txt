e0ad215 move the special selectivity specification from the size selex input to the survey units specification
28e7b02 get readdata and readcontrol separated into 324 and 330 versions;  create summary file called program_sequence.tpl for the major steps in the program flow
99b3014 a few more tweaks to the make files
8101016 divide readdata and readcontrol into 324 and 330 specific versions.  so far only edit 324readdata.  also makefiles are now make_ss_transition and make_SS_330
61c7311 finish the global_MSY reporting which now does knife edge and slot-age selectivity profile;  make some changes to improve the Fspr and Fbtgt searches;  still need to finish the tune-up of the L@maxages;  Also need to finish the implementation of age-selectivity
dc25d80 fix the recent change to SS_SELEX to calc all the fishery selectivities;      add show_MSY into call to get_benchmark;   add code to do global MSY by profiling over knife-edge age at first selectivity.
ce6bb89 small change to starting conditions for MSY search
329a46f Major re-work of ss_biofxn to get the calculation of mean size at maxage correct; but it still depends on a hardwired 'Z' value.  This seems correctable, but may be circular.   ALSO - still need to finish the age-specific discard in get_data and output and then testing.
92f652e various changes to improve creation of control.ss_new;
a5a84d0 major revamp of SS_selex to update Make_FishSelex to do age retention.  SImplify that code substantially so needs testing.

    Prepare for new area recruitment
    
    find that the spawnbio ratio approach to are-specific recruitment does
    not work well for equilibrium calcs;
    to prepare for a new approach with explicit SRR by area, change the
    spawn recruitment equilibrium function to pass some values.

    bycatch_fleets
    
    rename one of the fcast containers
    
    consider changes for bycatch fleets:
    Considered Changes for Bycatch Fleets
    
    currently bycatch fleets are excluded from direct calculation of F from
    input catch, and from the catch logL
    
    bycatch fleets have selectivity and retention functions, so even though
    they are considered to have unknown catch levels,
    this does not mean that their calculated retained catch is zero.
    
    I am considering the following changes:
    
    1.  provide switch so that bycatch only fleet:
    (a) can have retained and discarded catch calculated normally, or
    (b) all their catch will be assigned to discard
    
    2.  Because MSY and Yield per recruit are calculated in terms of dead
    catch, they currently include catch from bycatch fleets.
    provide switch so that:
    (a) bycatch only fleets are treated normally in benchmark and forecast
    (b) F for bycatch only fleets is kept constant in benchmark and
    forecast, so is not included in any forecast cap&allocation calculations
    the level of F for bycatch only fleets will then need to be set as a
    constant, or calculated as mean from a range of specified years
    
    ALSO:
    provide for max_catch_area in forecast to be year-specific and to have
    option of doing as a max or as a target.

    improve code for settlement timings and growth
    
    found that cannot have identical recruitment assignments because they
    would be assigned to the same settle_timing.  So now the number of
    parameters for timing will be based on the number of unique recruitment
    settlement timings.  Need to create a warning on this.
    
    ALSO  NOTE:  need to check on empirical wt-at-age and birthseasons.

    add description for 12/28 changes
    
    create basic survey of a mgparm dev
    add special selectivity type 35 to indicate such a survey
    add option for a Q additive offset in Q_setup(f,1).
    If ==1, then parm is density dependence per status quo code;
    if ==2 then parameter is additive offset.
    So these are mutually exclusive options.

    complete initial development of MGparm_dev
    
    create mean reverting random walk using rho.  Implement this as
    mgparm_dev_type=4
    //    =(1-rho)*mean + rho*prevval + dev   //  where mean = 0.0
    
    MGparm_dev_rwalk(k,j)=MGparm_dev_rho(k)*MGparm_dev_rwalk(k,j-1)+parm_dev(k,j);
    For each dev vector created, read the stdev and rho as short parameter
    lines just before reading mgparm_dev_phase

    completion of catch_multiplier
    
    Create a fleet-specific catch multiplier.
    So in the catch_Like calculation, expected catch is multiplied by
    catch_mult before doing the logL
    Also apply the multiplier within Pope's approx and within hybrid so that
    adjusted catch is matched to the observed, retained catch
    Create these multipliers as additional MGPARM so that they can inherit
    time-varying properties
    Internally, catch_mult(y,f) is year (not season) and fleet specific
    Because it is year-specific in storage (unlike growth which retains
    value until changed), a switch within mgparmsetup assures updating for
    each year of a block
    add FLAG in the data read to indicate which fleets will need a
    catch_mult created
    Output result in the CATCH section of report.sso
